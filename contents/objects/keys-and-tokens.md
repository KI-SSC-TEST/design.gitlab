name: Keys & Tokens

Keys and Tokens are objects that are used by users and systems to authenticate, encrypt, or verify actions. 

## Usability guidance (Creation)
---
**Use a [modal](https://design.gitlab.com/components/modal#usage).** Critical information can be revealed to users and its important that they stay on task while creating a new key or token. This action requires a user input to accomplish the task.

**Write concise copy.** Creating these objects often requires multiple steps. Keep actionable text in the modal, and provide assistance with links to documentation.

**Make the primary action useful.** Some keys will only be generated once, so help users reduce the likelihood that they will miss this step.
