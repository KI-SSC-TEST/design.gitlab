## Examples

Todo: Provide additional card examples.

Todo: Add link to design specs.

## Structure


Todo: Add structure diagram based on design specs.

1. **Container**: Wraps the content.
1. **Header** (optional): Contains the title.
1. **Title** (optional): Conveys the purpose of the card.
1. **Picture** (optional): Visual indication about the content of the card
1. **Content**: Contains a wide variety of content types and controls depending on the purpose.
1. **Actions** (optional): Buttons or links used to provide explicit action(s) the user can take related to the card content.

### Card layout


There are two different layouts for the cars: vertical and horizontal.

A horizontal layout fits better for bigger screen size. On the other hand, a vertical layout suits smaller screen sizes like mobile because the text can keep the small screen's entire length, which is better for readability.

### Page layout and breakpoints


**Three columns**

- Three columns are more suitable for vertical cards
- Cards spacing is 16 px; between columns spacing is 24px
- The minimum page size for three-column is 1200 px

**Two columns**

- Two-column can be for both horizontal or vertical cards
- Cards spacing is 24 px; between columns spacing is 40px
- The minimum page size for two-column is 768 px

**One column**

- One column is more suitable for vertical cards
- Cards spacing is 24px
- When the column width is smaller than 480px, we recommend using a vertical layout.

## Guidelines

### When to use

- Display a single, concise group of content within a set of similar, related groups. As a set, each card is meaningful on its own, but also in relationship and comparison to other cards.

### When not to use

- A card shouldn't be used for the sole purpose of styling a single block of content. Use available [utility classes](https://unpkg.com/browse/@gitlab/ui/src/scss/utilities.scss) instead.
- If you're only displaying static text or items that don't require comparison or additional grouping, consider using a [list](/components/list) instead.
- If you need to present or compare data, consider using a [table](/components/table) instead.
- If you need to show a high level overview of a single data point, use a single stat component. Todo: Add link to single stat component after it's been created

### Behavior

- Card width is fluid by default.
- A card can be static or draggable when there is an option to reorder it within a set of other cards.
  - When dragging the card to a new location, any cards positioned behind it should move to show their new placement as if the user were to let go of the selected card and drop it into the current position.
  - For touch devices there should be a longer hold on the card in order to grab it and move it, so that the user intent isn't confused with scrolling.
  - If a card contains an action, a button or link inside the card should trigger the action, not the entire card.

### Content

- All copy within a card should be short, actionable, and use clear language.
- A card should utilize the [skeleton loader](/components/skeleton-loader/) pattern when possible to represent loading content within.

#### Title

- Be brief and keep it to a single line by utilizing a sentence fragment.
- Avoid using punctuation such as periods, commas, or semicolons.
- Use a full stop only when it's a full sentence.

#### Body content

- Since a card can be used for many purposes, body content can be just about anything from an image to meta information and plain text.
- Body content for each card within a set should follow a similar pattern and structure so that the cards are scannable and consistent.

#### Image


- For a horizontal layout, the image should be top/left-aligned with the content container. 
- For a vertical layout, the image should be center-aligned with the content container.


#### Actions

Todo: Add examples based on design specs.

There are two types of actions that can be added to a card: Buttons (primary, secondary and tertiary) and links. Buttons are always left aligned, except in right-to-left languages where they are right aligned. The button order should follow the current [guidelines about how to use buttons](https://design.gitlab.com/components/button).

Buttons are always located at the bottom of the cards: they could take the entire width of the card and create its footer section, or it could be at the bottom in the text area when there is a picture element on the left. The button is obvious enough to tell the user that it is clickable, and there is no need to add hover status to the whole card.

Links are allowed within the content. When there are links mixed in the content, to make sure the user knows this is clickable, we can add hover status to the whole card as an affordance to indicate the clickable action.
