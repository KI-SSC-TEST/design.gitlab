      <h1>Iconography</h1>
      <p>One of our values is to create a distinguished GitLab personality that is strong and consistent. Iconography is a powerful visual cue to the user and should reflect our particular sense of style. Within GitLab Elements, we utilize symbols for our icons to take advantage of interchangeable overrides.</p>
      <h2>Usage</h2>
      <p>Icons are used to stress the visual weight for the elements with the high priority on a screen or to explain the universal knowledge in a simple way.</p>
      <p>The level of visual weight from heavy to light is: <strong>Icon + label > Icon > label.</strong></p>
      <p>Make sure the icons balance the visual weight in the particular usage.</p>
      <h2>Dos and Dont's</h2>
      <p>Don't use an icon to refer to different meanings.</p>
      <p>Don't use different icons to refer to a specific meaning.</p>
      <p>Don't frequently use the combination of an icon and a label.Using the combination only for the elements with high priority. For instance, we only use a icon + a label for the contextual navigation.</p>

      <h2>Developing new icons</h2>
      <p>Follow these guidleines when developing new icons:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Icons should be simple and use as few points as possible.</li>
        <li>All strokes should be converted to outlines.</li>
        <li>Use pathfinder tools to combine overlapping paths and create compound paths.</li>
        <li>All icons should be placed on a 16px by 16px artboard within the Icons symbol page.</li>
        <li>Icons should be masked with symbol that allows designers to easily change the color of the icon via an override.</li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
        <li>Standard size: 16px * 16px</li>
        <li>Border thickness: 2px</li>
        <li>Border radius: 3px</li>
