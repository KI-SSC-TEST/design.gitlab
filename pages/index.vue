        <h2 class="text-center">Professional and productive</h2>
        <p>GitLab is a tool to support what people do, day in, day out. We need to respect the importance of their work, and avoid gimicky details.</p>

      <div class="principle">
        <h2 class="text-center">Minimal and efficient</h2>
        <p>While work can get complicated, GitLab is about bringing a sharp focus, helping our customers know what matters now.</p>

      <div class="principle">
        <h2 class="text-center">Immediately recognizable</h2>
        <p>When you look at any screen, you should know immediately that it is GitLab. Our personality is strong and consistent across product and marketing experiences.</p>

      <div class="principle">
        <h2 class="text-center">Human and quirky</h2>
        <p>We need to build empathy with our users, understand their state of mind, and connect with them on a human level. Quirkiness is part of our DNA; we should embrace it in the right moments and contexts.</p>
