A conceptual object model is a visual representation of the system's **objects** and **actions**, and enumerates the **attributes** for every object. This model allows for proper separation of concerns: concepts (meaning) and user interface (representation; see [layouts](#layouts)). In other words, a conceptual model is only focused on the concepts and how they relate to each other, not how it’s technically implemented or used in the UI. 

## Conceptual model

<!--
Start with documenting the conceptual object model in the [Figma Conceptual Model file.](https://www.figma.com/file/J68bePHXIN5OPWqaFFY9ri/Conceptual-model?node-id=0%3A1)

The language of the conceptual model diagram is meant to be as simple and accessible as possible to everyone, even if they are not familiar with these kinds of diagrams (for more information, see [Object Modeling for Designers](https://medium.com/@hpadkisson/object-modeling-for-designers-an-introduction-7871bdcf8baf).

Embed the conceptual model using the following code.

<div class="figma-embed" aria-label="Conceptual diagram connecting objects, along with their attributes and actions, to the primary object." role="img">
  <iframe frameborder="0" src="figma-embed-link" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
-->

## Layouts

<!--
Document the object's semantic layout in the [Figma Semantic Layouts file.](https://www.figma.com/file/shVF8UZwrQtkNfMDjcrsyH/Semantic-layouts?node-id=0%3A1)

The object itself is likely to be represented in the UI through different layouts, each with a different purpose. When we look at the object layout through the lens of the conceptual object model, we see the object's semantic layout. It's the visualization of the layout, overlayed with the object's relationships, attributes and actions.

Start with documenting the primary object layout (for example, a Merge Request page fot the Merge Request object).
